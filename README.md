This repository is part of an institute research project on Quantum Machine Learning, specifically on the generation of images through a quantum circuit.

Quantum Machine Learning is one of the most promising applications of Quantum Computing. In this work, I present a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (qGAN) for generating gray-scale bar images. Through the Fr√©chet Distance score, I evaluate the effectiveness of a partial measurement on the simulated quantum circuit that generates the images. This score shows that the measurement improves qGAN performance by avoiding an oscillation on the resemblance between the generated and the real images, that is, an alternation of good and poor quality generated images that occurs through optimization of the qGAN. For queries to the author open an issue.
